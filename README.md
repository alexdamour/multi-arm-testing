\emph{RatioAnalysis.Rmd} is the analysis for ratio $r_1=\frac{Y_1}{\sigma_1}$ and $r_k=\frac{\sigma_1}{\sigma_k}$, including the homoscedasticity case and heteroscedasticity case.

\emph{TreatmentSizeK.Rmd} is the analysis for treatment size $K$ including the variation of power and critical ratio when $K$ increases.

\emph{PvalueFunction.R} is the function to compute different $p$-value.

\emph{RatioPower.R} is the function to compute different ratio power.
