RatioAnalysis.Rmd is the analysis for ratio r1=Y1/sig1 and rk=sig1/sigk, including the homoscedasticity case and heteroscedasticity case.

TreatmentSizeK.Rmd is the analysis for treatment size K including the variation of power and critical ratio when K increases.

PvalueFunction.R is the function to compute different p-value.

RatioPower.R is the function to compute different ratio power.
